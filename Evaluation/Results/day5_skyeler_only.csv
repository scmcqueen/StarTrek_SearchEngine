GEORDI: Doctor, I get the feeling you think beards are nothing more than an affectation.","BRENNA: You may have all the time in the world, but I've dozens of frightened and hungry women and children to care for. RIKER: What about the men? BRENNA: I'm sure they'll find their comfort as they always do -- in the bottom of a mug of home brew!,SARINA: Why are you pretending that it's not true? EZRI: Because they're men. EZRI: And men have trouble expressing their feelings.,PULASKI: Out. BRENNA: You know how to handle men. PULASKI: Yes, first you have to get their attention.,DAX: You really are obsessed with appearances, aren't you? KIRA: And your taste in men... frightens me. DAX: I'll tell Worf you said so.,TROI: Perhaps that's why men remain so attractive. PULASKI: Particularly men like Commander Riker? TROI: As well as his father, I'm sure...","SONNY: What's that? RIKER: An android. SONNY: You mean a robot?,TROI: So... you're no longer a Human? TIMOTHY: I'm an android. TROI: When did this happen?,ARDRA: Such speed and accuracy. You're much too talented to be human... DATA: I am an android. ARDRA: Android. Of course. How wonderful. An unexpected bonus.,ISHARA: You're not human. DATA: I am an android. ISHARA: Built for fighting... ?,TROI: Established parameters? You sound like Data. TIMOTHY: I am an android. TROI: I see... Well. Let's go for our walk, shall we?,DATA: I am attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you. SETAL: You're the android. SETAL: I know a host of Romulan cyberneticists who would love to be this close to you.,WORF: I've asked Lieutenant Commander Data to help us analyze the alternatives. K'EHLEYR: An android chaperone? DATA: ""Android"" is, of course, correct, but I fail to see how ""chaperone"" is applicable in this situation...,ADMIRAL: I don't see any points on your ears, boy, but you sound like a Vulcan. DATA: No, sir. I am an android. ADMIRAL: Almost as bad.,TROI: When did this happen? TIMOTHY: I've always been an android. TROI: What's it like... being an android?,Q: Sure, the robot who teaches the course in humanities. DATA: I am an android, not a robot. Q: I beg your pardon.,TIMOTHY: I've always been an android. TROI: What's it like... being an android? TIMOTHY: I am designed to exceed human capacity both mentally and physically. But I do not experience emotions.,DATA: It does appear unlikely that you will ever be allowed to return to your world again. SETAL: The cold reaction of an android. DATA: But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you.,NAYROK: I have dispatched a ship to rendezvous with you and transport the prisoner back to Lunar Five. On behalf of Angosia, I thank the Federation for its assistance in retrieving our citizen. ROGA: Were you built for combat, android? DATA: No. But my program does include military strategy... that is how I was finally able to anticipate your last tactic and capture you.,BEVERLY: I beg your pardon? SONNY: What's his name... that android fella. BEVERLY: Lieutenant Commander Data?,TIMOTHY: You sound like you don't want to be an android. DATA: I am an android. That will never change. TIMOTHY: But... if you could change... would you?","DARVIN: Nothing so mundane. Let's just say that Kirk's death will have a certain... poetic justice to it. SISKO: He put a bomb in a Tribble? ODO: It's his ""revenge."" Originally, Kirk saw the way a Tribble reacted to Darvin and realized he was a Klingon.,O'BRIEN: Captain, I don't think we'll be able to get to K-Seven's internal sensors. SISKO: Then you'll have to manually scan every Tribble on the station. O'BRIEN: There must be thousands of them by now.,SPOCK - CLIP: One million, seven hundred and seventy-one thousand, five hundred and sixty-one. SPOCK  - CLIP: That's assuming one Tribble multiplying with an average litter of ten... SISKO: Found it...,SISKO: He put a bomb in a Tribble? ODO: It's his ""revenge."" Originally, Kirk saw the way a Tribble reacted to Darvin and realized he was a Klingon. ODO: He wouldn't tell us where this... Tribble is, but he did say it would go off within the hour.,WORF: Hundreds of warriors were sent to track them down throughout the galaxy. An armada obliterated the Tribbles' homeworld. By the end of the twenty-third century, they were eradicated. ODO: Another glorious chapter in Klingon history. Tell me, do they still sing songs about the great Tribble hunt? COM: Red Alert. Red Alert. All hands to battle stations. This is not a drill.","PICARD: About Spock. SAREK: Spock? PICARD: Yes. He's missing.,SAREK: Live long and... and... ... live long and... SAREK: Spock... my son... PICARD: ... and prosper.,SISKO: Kirk had quite the reputation as a ladies' man. DAX: Not him. Spock. SISKO: Let's go.,SELA: The great Spock. Very well. Senator Pardek, your service to the Romulan people is noted and appreciated. PARDEK: Jolan True, Spock. SELA: Do not be distressed. Your dream of reunification is not dead. It will only take a slightly different form... the Romulan conquest of Vulcan.,PICARD: Not unexpected. The man is dying. And I have the... honor... to bring him the news that his son may have betrayed the Federation. RIKER: How well do you know Spock? PICARD: I met him only once... what I know of him comes from history books and of course the mind meld with his father...,SPOCK: Yes. You did. PARDEK: Spock, we've been friends for eighty years... SPOCK: It is the only logical conclusion. You invited me to Romulus. You arranged the meeting with the Proconsul. And you knew that Picard and Data had returned to the surface with new information.,SPOCK: As you wish. NERAL: Good. Jolan True, Spock. Oh... Live long and prosper. ROMULAN#1: It's everything we could have hoped for...","PICARD: I have never subscribed to the theory that political power flows from the barrel of a gun, Data... DATA: In most instances, you would be correct. But there are numerous examples where it was successful... the independence of the Mexican State from Spain, the Irish Unification of 2024, the Kenzie Rebellion... PICARD: Yes, I'm aware of them...","DATA: It is a solar flare, Captain. Magnitude: twelve. Class: B. PICARD: Shields? WORF: Shields are up... but only at twenty-three percent.,WORF: Starboard power coupling is down... warp engines off-line. RIKER: Shields? WORF: Down to thirteen percent.,WESLEY: They're charging their weapons, sir... WORF: Shields! RIKER: Return fire!,O'BRIEN: They'll have us in weapons range in twenty-two seconds. DAX: Shields? NOG: Shields at thirty percent.,WORF: Captain, we're heading straight into the path of that stellar matter.... PICARD: Shields up. WORF: Negative. The shields won't respond.,RIKER: Engage forward shields -- thirty-five percent. WORF: Shields up. PICARD: Drop to one quarter impulse, Ensign.,PICARD: Full stop. Doctor Marr, continue emitting your signal. On screen, Mister Worf. RIKER: Shields up. DOCTOR MARR: It's beautiful...","PICARD: Keep me posted, Picard out. PICARD: Guinan... ? GUINAN: We need to talk. Now. It's all wrong, Captain. This is not the way it's supposed to be.,GEORDI: On my way, Commander. GEORDI: Save my seat, Guinan. GUINAN: Always room at the bar for another broken heart.,PICARD: Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs Ten-Forward. PICARD: How is Lal doing, Guinan? GUINAN: She spills a few drinks like the rest of us. But she's learning a lot.,GUINAN: No, we're not. I mean, we shouldn't be. This is a ship of peace. Not of war. PICARD: Guinan, what you're suggesting... GUINAN: It's not a suggestion, Captain. And that ship from the past... it was not supposed to come here. It's got to go back.,YOUNG GUINAN: Yeah... I can see it in your eyes... you can barely resist the urge to leap up and start jumping around like a Tarkassian razorbeast. YOUNG RO: (smiling despite herself) Guinan... YOUNG GUINAN: Oh yeah... oh yeah...,RO: Who are you? GUINAN: Guinan. I tend the bar. I listen. RO: You're not like any bartender I ever met.,RO: Who are you? GUINAN: Guinan. I keep the bar. I listen. RO: Heard anything interesting?","LWAXANA: Take your hands off her. RIKER: Mrs. Troi -- LWAXANA: Don't ""Mrs. Troi"" me.,O'BRIEN: I believe Counselor Troi is the senior officer on the bridge. RO: Counselor Troi? O'BRIEN: She carries the rank of Lieutenant Commander.,MRS. TROI: I am always serious, dear boy. Only my pleasant nature makes it appear otherwise. WYATT: Please, Mrs. Troi. MRS. TROI: Yes, that was puzzling. A woman out of another place who insists she knows you.","YELN: I'll try and... (Yeln stops and stares at Kira) Wait... I remember you... You were there, too, weren't you? Kiri something? KIRA: Kira. Kira Nerys. YELN: I almost didn't recognize you. You used to wear your hair differently, didn't you? Longer?,ODO: Who? QUARK: Kira. ODO: That's ridiculous.,WINN: We've met before, haven't we. You're Major... Major... KIRA: Kira Nerys... WINN: That's right, Major Kira. From the space station. What brings you here?,ODO: She's nothing like Kira. LOLA: Who's Kira? VIC: Of course she's not Kira -- she's a hologram.",,,"WORF: Do not tie my hands now... I must be able to prove my father's innocence. The Federation records will do that. PICARD: Mister Worf... Mister Worf... Mister Worf... PICARD: Here I am lecturing you on a conflict of interest while I'm desperately trying to avoid one of my own. Do you think I wish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council? Do you think I cannot see the implications for the Federation? And good Lord, Duras tried to have me killed! All of my instincts... my training... my very being as a Starfleet officer are at odds with my responsibilities as arbiter for the Klingon High Council. We walk the same tightrope between two worlds... you and I. We must try our very best to keep those worlds clearly separate... or we shall certainly fall.,WORF: I am going to kill him! With my bare hands, I will take his neck and -- RIKER: Worf. WORF: I have failed in my mission, Commander. I am clearly a bad diplomat. For the sake of the ship and the Federation... I request reassignment.,GUINAN: Worf... he never had prune juice until he came in here... now he can't get enough of it... HELENA: Worf? SERGEY: He didn't want any human foods growing up... everything had to be Klingon...,PICARD: I understand your pain... we all felt very close to K'Ehleyr. A reprimand will be on your record. Dismissed. PICARD: Worf... PICARD: Isn't it time for the truth about your father's innocence to be told? After all, the reasons you accepted this dishonor were to protect the name of Duras, and hold the Empire together.
