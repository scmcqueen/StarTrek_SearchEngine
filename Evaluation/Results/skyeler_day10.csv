COMPUTER: Ensign Ro is not on board the Enterprise.,KEEVE: You honor me by the proper use of my name, Captain. PICARD: Ensign Ro has educated me. KEEVE: Has she. Good. I'm pleased you still remember.,DATA: Computer, locate Ensign Ro. COMPUTER: Ensign Ro is not on board the Enterprise. WORF: Check the transport log.,GUINAN: Ensign Ro has some things to talk to you about. PICARD: Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters. GUINAN: She can go right back to her quarters when she's done.,PICARD: Come. GUINAN: Ensign Ro has some things to talk to you about. PICARD: Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters.,RIKER: Energize. RO: Ensign Ro Laren reporting as ordered, Commander. RIKER: You'll follow the Starfleet uniform code aboard this ship, Ensign.,KENNELLY: Well done, Captain. PICARD: It was a team effort, Admiral. Ensign Ro proved invaluable. KENNELLY: Good. What's the next step?","RIKER: You think we'll have a chance to take a look at that new starship of yours? What's it called... ? KIRA: The Defiant. RIKER: Yeah, the Defiant. I hear it's quite a vessel.,SISKO: Hello, Major. Sorry to startle you, but I wanted to test the Defiant's cloaking device. KIRA: The Defiant? SISKO: I've brought back a little surprise for the Dominion.,O'BRIEN: Recognize her? SISKO: The Defiant. O'BRIEN: During our last encounter, when I ""visited"" your station... ... I took a moment and downloaded as many of your computer files as I could. Figured they'd come in handy one day. And they have. You see, captain, taking Terok Nor was one thing... keeping it, now that's the tricky part. The Alliance fleet is already on its way and when they get here, I want to give them a proper welcome.,NOG: Jem'Hadar or Cardassian? JAKE: It's... It's the Defiant! NOG: What?,JAKE: I have to go. It's my job. Now if you don't want me on the Defiant, fine. I'll go with General Martok -- get the story from a Klingon perspective... SISKO: All right. The Defiant it is. JAKE: So when do we leave?,DAMAR: (he can't figure it out either) I don't know... DAMAR: The Defiant has opened fire on us. WEYOUN: Obviously.","GEORDI: Yes... with a worthy opponent. PICARD: Worthy of Holmes? GEORDI: Oh, my God. I asked for a Sherlock Holmes-type mystery with an opponent capable of defeating Data. That must be it.,DATA: Why Lestrade of course. LESTRADE : Holmes, are you there, man? LESTRADE: Thank the Almighty you're available tonight, Holmes, I'm in a deuce of a dilemma.,LESTRADE : It's murder, Holmes, murder most foul. GEORDI: Well, Holmes, let's hear it. DATA: There is nothing here of relevance. I do not see how this connects with the disappearance of the doctor.,GEORDI: What was the point to going onto the Holodeck? DATA: To solve a Sherlock Holmes mystery. GEORDI: Exactly, but, you've got them all memorized. The first time someone opens their mouth, you've got it solved. So, there's really no mystery. If there's no mystery... there's no game... no game... no fun.,DATA: Then may I say your perturbation becomes you, Inspector Lestrade, whilst simultaneously affording me yet another chance to serve Queen and country. GEORDI: Data, is that the way Holmes really talked? DATA: Absolutely.,MORIARTY: The best kind, I'm sure. But I need information. GEORDI: Data -- I mean... Holmes old boy, what are we looking for? DATA: For whatever finds us, dear Watson.,DATA: Dixon Hill is a most puzzling character. GEORDI: Not really. He was just a twentieth-century Sherlock Holmes. DATA: But his modus operandi is quite dissimilar. Worth investigating.","QUARK: Perhaps a short adventure in a holosuite... TOSK: Holosuite... ? QUARK: A fantasy encounter with danger, romance, thrills... created for your personal entertainment by the Quark Brothers...,LWAXANA: So... where are you ladies off to? KIRA: A holosuite... DAX: King Arthur's Court...,QUARK: And last but not least, one free hour in a holosuite -- with the program of your choice. KIRA: A visit to a holosuite... ? QUARK: Offer good today only.,NOG: I've been going over your books. This place is a latinum-mine and you don't even know it. In my opinion, it's time to expand the business. EZRI: Nog, this is a holosuite. NOG: Of course it's a holosuite. But that doesn't mean we can't build a new casino.,TIRON: You know, if this program is as good as you claim, I might just purchase it from you to use at home. QUARK: You... have your own holosuite... ? TIRON: Just a little present I bought myself...,WORF: Worf here. SISKO: Have you secured the holosuite? WORF: Yes, sir.,EZRI: He's not crazy. SISKO: But he is living in a holosuite. EZRI: At first, it struck me as a little... peculiar. But after I thought it over, I began to think that maybe this is a good sign after all.,VIC: He tells me everything. We've been spending a lot of time together. KIRA: Odo? Spending time in a holosuite? VIC: And loving it.,DAX: We'd better get going if we're going to make that holosuite reservation. WORF: Holosuite -- and insult the O'Briens? DAX: We wouldn't want to do that.,ODO: You wanted to see us? DAX: Is that the new holosuite program? BASHIR: The next chapter in the continuing adventures of Julian Bashir, Secret Agent. It came in this morning.,WORF: Who can forget him? O'BRIEN: And those holosuite programs of his? WORF: The Three Musketeers.,QUARK: Now that's what I call a picnic. QUARK: I believe Holosuite Six is available. QUARK: That Morn, he always was a sucker for a Phalonian Holo-program.","PICARD: On screen. PICARD: Tasha? SELA: No, Captain. I am Commander Sela. The woman you knew as Tasha Yar... was my mother.,""Q"" : This is a court of the year 2049, by which time more 'rapid progress' had caused all 'United Earth' nonsense to be abolished. PICARD: Tasha, no... TASHA: I must... ... because I grew up on a world that allowed things like this court. And it was people like these that saved me from it. I say that this so-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is, what it represents...,TROI: We should establish clearly also, that Lutan is dangerous. Self image for him is a function of how much he THINKS he's achieved. Those who set their standards too high can kill to meet them. BEVERLY: Why Tasha? TROI: As a Starfleet security officer, she may have represented his riskiest prize.,ISHARA: Our parents were killed in some crossfire just after I was born. Some people took care of us for a few months... Then one day we came home and they were gone. So Tasha took care of me. And when I got old enough, I joined the Coalition. DATA: And Tasha did not? ISHARA: My sister hated the cadres. Blamed them for our parents death. For everything. She refused to join. And she left as soon as she had the chance.,TASHA: No, I'm sorry. It's so frustrating to be controlled like this... PICARD: Lieutenant...Tasha... it's all right... TASHA: What the hell am I doing? Crying?,DATA: The Tactical Station -- where Lieutenant Worf is now. ISHARA: Did Tasha have many friends here? DATA: Yes. She was especially close to Commander Riker and Lieutenant Worf. And to myself.","KIRA: Gul Dukat, we know you're headed for the wormhole... DUKAT: Wormhole? Which wormhole is that? KIRA: I strongly suggest you do not proceed. We encountered a hostile lifeform inside...,KIRA: Listen, something is very wrong here... I think we must've taken a wrong turn in the wormhole... WORF: Wormhole... ? KIRA: The wormhole to the Gamma... This is very difficult to explain... I think the best thing would be for us just to get back on our ship and...,WORF: Still picking up energy distortions -- but fading. It seems to be gone. PICARD: A wormhole? DATA: Very likely. Small and extremely unstable wormholes have been mapped near thirty-nine T-tauri systems in the last one hundred years alone.,KIRA: Things have changed, Tahna. Now that the wormhole has been discovered... TAHNA: Yes, the wormhole. KIRA: Look, I don't want the Federation here any more than you do... but they are serving a purpose. For the time being, at least.,DAX: Velocity is twenty kph. I'm picking up an atmosphere, Benjamin... SISKO: Inside a wormhole? DAX: Capable of supporting life...,SISKO: Another ship... in the wormhole? JENNIFER ALIEN: ""Wormhole"" - what is this? SISKO: It is how we describe the kind of passage that brought me here...,KIRA: Everything here is fine. There's no sign of Dominion activity. SISKO: What about the wormhole? DAX: It's acting normally again. It stopped opening and closing at random not long after you left.","SISKO: Welcome to the Alpha Quadrant. I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko of the United Federation of Planets. TOSK: Alpha quadrant? SISKO: You have passed through a wormhole into a new part of the galaxy...,GARAK: The Jem'Hadar will destroy every ship if we stay. GARAK: The only hope is to return to the Alpha Quadrant. LOVOK: There's no way out of here, Garak. The Jem'Hadar have cut us off. We need to consolidate the fleet and make our stand here.,JACK: Look at this -- Starfleet battle plans, fleet deployments -- do you know what the Dominion could do with this information? LAUREN: They could take the Alpha Quadrant in a matter of weeks. JACK: With a lot fewer Federation casualties than in a drawn out war.,WORF: We have to warn the station. There is only one reason for the Dominion to hide such a large fleet this close to the wormhole. GARAK: You think they're planning to attack the Alpha Quadrant. WORF: I am certain of it.,O'BRIEN: I've cleared the Skrreean ship to dock at upper pylon two. SISKO: Time to welcome your people to the Alpha Quadrant, Haneek... HANEEK: Come on... don't be afraid... we're among friends...,SISKO: A Dominion invasion of Ferenginar? ROM: Think of the terrible repercussions to the Alpha Quadrant. WORF: I can't think of any.,QUARK: (no longer hiding anything) A week? DAMAR: That's right, one week and the Alpha Quadrant will be ours. SISKO: Gentlemen, this mission cannot succeed without the involvement of the Klingon Defense Forces.,DUKAT: Isn't that obvious? DUKAT: To give you what you desire above all else. The Alpha Quadrant. DUKAT: All I need is a certain Bajoran artifact... one of the many that the Cardassians ""appropriated"" during the occupation.,ODO: I know. KIRA: You know! Do you realize you handed the Alpha Quadrant to the Dominion? ODO: I was in the Link.,WORF: The misdeeds your troops have committed speak for themselves. Assaulting a Cardassian tailor. Detaining and searching ships in neutral space without warning or provocation. And you... executing one of your own commanders because he refused to fire on a Federation ship... MARTOK: Whatever we've done has been in the best interests of the Alpha Quadrant. WORF: You must think me a fool to make your lies so transparent.,BASHIR: And then what? NOG: And then we make the Dominion sorry they ever set foot in the Alpha Quadrant. SISKO: Cadet, you took the words right out of my mouth.,O'BRIEN: You don't want to know... FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: Send a message to our listening posts in the Gamma Quadrant. Tell the reinforcements that the Alpha Quadrant awaits them. DAMAR: Sir, the Defiant... it's headed for the wormhole.,SISKO: Permission granted. GOWRON: This is a dark day, not only for the Klingon Empire, but for the Alpha Quadrant itself. SISKO: So what are we going to do about it?,BASHIR: I wasn't aware the Romulans had been excluded. T'RUL: Every great power in the Alpha Quadrant has been invited to participate except for us. BASHIR: There must be some mistake.,KIRA: At what price? You've sold Cardassia to the Dominion. DUKAT: A high price, to be sure. But look what we're getting in return -- the Alpha Quadrant itself. KIRA: We'll see about that.","RIVAN: ... and so no one risks death. WORF: Death? RIVAN: ... by breaking any law.,PICARD: Perhaps everything with the compass design is part of the same theme -- movement. Finding a direction, travelling a path, crossing a boundary-- RIKER: And ""death."" One of the symbols was ""death."" PICARD: The ultimate boundary.,GEORDI: What do you mean? RO: This. Death. GEORDI: What?,ODO: Humanoid death rituals are an interest of mine. QUARK: Death rituals. ODO: Everybody needs a hobby.,GOWRON: What is this? WORF: It is your death. GOWRON: No.,KANG: I say we attack here... a bold assault right at the main threshold. The guards will be too scattered to respond in time. We will overwhelm the defenders and fight on to a glorious victory. KOLOTH: Or to a glorious death. KOR: It is a good day to die.,TASHA: Do you know how? GUINAN: No. But I know that it was an empty death. A death without purpose. PICARD: Come.,DATA: Attack me. Or are you afraid? WORF: I have no fear of death.
