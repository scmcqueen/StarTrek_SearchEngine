SISKO: I saw it too.,CHRIS: You know, I'll probably lose my license for this... But at least I'll get good ratings. HENRY: ... my name is Henry Garcia... and I've been living here two years now... I came to San Francisco to work in a brewery... but they laid a bunch of us off when they got some new equipment... and so I ended up here. HENRY: I've never been in trouble with the law or anything... I don't want to hurt anybody... I just want a chance to work and live like regular people...,O'BRIEN: Any news from Starfleet? KIRA: Nothing good. As far as they can tell, Commander Sisko and the others never materialized in San Francisco. According to their sensors, our transporter signal disintegrated immediately after we began the beam out sequence. O'BRIEN: That doesn't agree with our records. The system log shows that the transport was completed successfully. They definitely materialized somewhere.","SISKO: You think some kind of program from the probe is influencing our computer... ? O'BRIEN: Well, it's got to be more than just a program. The computer's whole... personality has changed. She's obedient, almost submissive... and then there's this one other crazy thing I'm almost afraid to mention... SISKO: What's that?","PICARD: I know. Robin Hood. WORF: Sir, I protest. I am not a merry man. DATA: On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf, your clothing identifies you with the character of Will Scarlett. Just as Geordi's Mandolin suggests he is Alan-A-Dale.,QUARK: From now on, every hour is Happy Hour. At least, until business picks up. QUARK: Eat, drink and be merry. BASHIR: For tomorrow we die.","PICARD: Ah... no, of course. It was... the memory I was calling up. (finds a smile for Beverly) Sorry. TROI: Memory or... ""nightmare?"" PICARD: Well, it was strong, whatever it was. Ready, Number One.,LOLA: But we just met tonight. ODO: I must have a short memory. LOLA: You're funny.,BEVERLY: That day on Onias Three you were infected with a strain of Altarian encephalitis. A retrovirus that incorporates its DNA directly into the cells of its host. It can lie dormant for years, then suddenly become active, as it did in your case ten days ago. You've been in a coma, delirious... Your fever finally broke this morning... RIKER: But what happened to my memory? BEVERLY: This is a scan of your brain tissue. When the encephalitis became active... it caused widespread synapse degradation, interrupting the consolidation of memory...,JULIANA: I still can't believe it... seeing you again after all these years... DATA: Doctor, I have no memory of you. JULIANA: There's a reason for that... we wiped your processors after we'd finished refining your programming.,RIKER: Speaking of time, Lieutenant, this may be your time. I shall personally miss you. DATA: You will always be in my memory. GEORDI: Data... wait a minute. Can't we.. ?,PICARD: Please... if you could tell me... what is this place? Where am I? BATAI: The fever... it's taken your memory. PICARD: That must be it. Perhaps you could help me...,JOHN: You must not take me home, Captain. BEVERLY: John, your memory... has it returned? JOHN: All I know is that we came out here to escape.,PICARD: What happened back there, Lieutenant? WORF: I believe I had another... memory loss. RIKER: ""Memory loss""... What are you talking about?,K'EHLEYR: Perhaps you have changed. You weren't this aloof six years ago... or don't you remember? WORF: There is nothing wrong with my memory. K'EHLEYR: Well, there's something wrong with the rest of you. You're not even looking at me.","EZRI: Lieutenant junior grade Ezri Dax at your service. YANAS: Ezri... Dax. EZRI: The symbiont name always replaces the family name of the... new host. It's traditional.,O'BRIEN: (shoring up his resolve) I love my wife. BASHIR: And I love Ezri. O'BRIEN: You do?,BASHIR: Something wrong? O'BRIEN: It's about Ezri. And you. BASHIR: I'm not sure I'm following...,EZRI: Miles! O'BRIEN: Ezri? What're you doing here? EZRI: This is my home... ... my mother.","ARISSA: What are you reading? ODO: It's a detective novel. ARISSA: Have you figured out who did it yet?,DATA: Curious... There seems to be a problem in the Holodeck's spatial orientation systems. GENTLEMAN: London's greatest detective... GEORDI: Freeze program.,COMPUTER: File or access code. PICARD: File Dixon Hill, private detective. COMPUTER: Enter when ready.,PICARD: I hate a mystery. DATA: But, sir what about Dixon Hill, and your penchant for detective fiction -- PICARD: Allow me to correct myself. I hate a mystery I cannot solve.,PICARD : Captain's log, supplemental. I am delighted with how the Holodeck has created the fictional world of Dixon Hill... PICARD : ... the twentieth century detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood. PICARD : The illusion is flawless. The computer characters accept me as Dixon Hill, even to the extent that Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's wife from the wrong side of the tracks, wants to hire me.,BASHIR: The last message I got said that he was still in New Sydney, and that he was following up on some promising leads. SISKO: He's not a detective! He's an engineer -- he's my chief engineer and now he's missing! SISKO: So tell me about this woman he's supposed to be looking for.,PICARD: In the world of fact, it is, Data. However in literature, criminal detection becomes a fascinating exercise. The immortal Sherlock Holmes would have an interesting view of our mystery, I believe. RIKER: I'm sure, sir -- but I'm afraid we have to find our solution without History's Greatest Consulting Detective. WESLEY: Is it there, Mister Singh? If the control network breaks at that point...,KIRA: What do you mean? ODO: In the detective novels Chief O'Brien gives me to read, when the hero says, ""We've been in tougher scrapes than this one,"" his friends always agree. KIRA: I never read any of those books.,DATA : Captain Picard was the person who first interested me in the works of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle. DATA : I have subsequently become a great admirer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his ability to solve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence. DATA : I have found Holmes' methodology of deductive reasoning to be quite useful in performing my duties. One of his adages is that once you have eliminated the impossible...,PICARD: What are you suggesting? DATA: I am referring to the Great Detective's credo, sir. I quote... ""We must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" GEORDI: Wes, everything's fixed now.,RIKER: Knock 'em dead, Captain. PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Archeology Council. Welcome. It is the mystery of Tagus Three that brings us together today... a mystery that has invited more argument and deduction than the best Sherlock Holmes or Dixon Hill tale. Well, if you'll excuse the conceit, you're about to hear my own detective story. PICARD : For several years, I have been trying to unravel the secrets of Tagus Three. Needless to say, I have not succeeded.","DAX: Room service. I want to be pampered. I want a staff to cater to our every whim. I want to be embarrassed by the size of our room. I want a balcony with a view that makes you want to break down and cry from the sheer beauty of it all. And I don't want to spend one moment of our honeymoon suffering from anything except guilt about our complete self- indulgence. WORF: Risa? DAX: Not this time.,VASH: You know, I believe you're right. VASH: Welcome to Risa. PICARD: A simple handshake would have sufficed.,DAX: I've had better vacations. ARANDIS: Better than Risa? DAX: I never knew a Klingon who had a tougher time enjoying himself.,DAX: And you're not saying good-bye to me either. I'll be back. ARANDIS: Risa will be waiting. DAX: So what do we do now?,FULLERTON: You're leaving? WORF: I've had my fill of Risa. FULLERTON: Mister Worf, you've been an inspiration to us all.,RIKER: So I've gathered. BEVERLY: They met during his visit to Risa. RIKER: On Risa? That must have been a better vacation than he let on.,VASH: If it wasn't for me, you'd still be back there sitting in the sun... relaxing. PICARD: That happens to be why I came to Risa. VASH: I'm sure you hated every minute of it. That kind of vacation isn't for a man like you. You need excitement.","HUGH: No -- DATA: Lore... LORE: Be careful with that, Brother. Somebody could get hurt.,DATA: You leave me no other choice. DATA: Good bye, Lore. LORE: I... love you... Brother...,LORE: He was. But they found him imperfect and I was made to replace him. LORE: You may call me Lore. PICARD: I'm also a bit troubled by it describing you as ""imperfect."",LORE: (seemingly sincere, he whispers) I don't have to imagine. I know how hard it's been. But, you'll be surprised Data... feelings do funny things. You may even learn to understand your ""evil"" brother... to forgive him. We will be more alike, you and I. You'll see. I'm happy for you. DATA: I question your sincerity, Lore. SOONG: Perhaps with this you'll learn to be more trusting, Data. Your brother has had good reason to be bitter.,LORE: (angry and almost in tears) Next logical step?! DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. SOONG: Enough! Sit down, both of you.,SOONG: You were the first. You meant as much to me as Data ever did. But you were unstable. The colonists weren't envious of you, they were afraid of you. You were unstable. DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. LORE: Why didn't you try to fix me? It was within your power to fix me!,SOONG: Perhaps with this you'll learn to be more trusting, Data. Your brother has had good reason to be bitter. DATA: But sir, Lore was responsible for... SOONG: He wasn't given the chance you and I were given... to live. (still talking to Data, he looks at Lore) But now I'm sure he understands why I had to do what I did. If there was only time left, I could help you as well... what a shame. The procedure is quite simple, but I'll need to rest first, I'm tired.,BEVERLY: How badly are you hurt... Data? DATA: I will function sufficiently to stop Lore, Doctor... DATA: Whatever happens, it is important that you two stay away from him. Do not try to help me.","SISKO: Curzon always said he wanted to show me the Trill homeworld. Looks like I'm going to get there after all. BASHIR: How long before we reach Trill? SISKO: A little over thirty-seven hours. How's Dax?,BASHIR: Your hands are cold... DAX: That is a peculiarity of the Trill... BASHIR: Cold hands, warm heart...,EZRI: I was on the Destiny when the Dax symbiont was brought on board to be taken back to Trill. Halfway through the trip, it took a turn for the worse and had to be placed in a host immediately. SISKO: And you were the only Trill on board. EZRI: I laid down on the operating table as one person and woke up a different person... actually, eight different people. I wasn't prepared for any of it. You're supposed to go through years of training and preparation before being joined. All I got was a fifteen minute lecture from the ships's surgeon. And he wasn't even a Trill.,KIRA: And what happened? BASHIR: They were exiled from the Trill homeworld. KIRA: That would mean their symbionts would never be joined to new hosts.,DAX: That's unusual for a Ferengi. PEL: I never heard of a Trill who played tongo. DAX: I guess that makes us both unusual. You know I was impressed by your show of loyalty to Quark last night.,QUARK: We're not stealing it for them, we're stealing it to save Zek. ROM: But what about this other Ezri? She's a Trill. QUARK: So?,LASARAN: A Klingon... why did they have to send a Klingon... ? DAX: I'm a Trill. Does that make you feel any better? LASARAN: Are you trying to be funny?,QUARK: Zhian'tara... what's that? LEETA: It's the Trill Rite of Closure... I've read about it... DAX: The zhian'tara is a ritual where joined Trills get the chance to actually meet their previous hosts...","MARRITZA: I admit everything. Why not? I was the best at what I did. My accomplishments speak for themselves. Can you say the same? You and that little Shakaar resistance cell you belonged to. You did nothing but annoy Cardassians, while I was busy exterminating Bajorans. KIRA: Make sure you tell that to the tribunal. MARRITZA: Oh, I will.,WEYOUN: I'm always serious. You see, if you don't do as I ask, I'll have to hand you over to Legate Damar... ... and you know how ruthless Cardassians can be. DAMAR: ""It is my duty to inform you that you are to be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal to stand trial as war criminals."" EZRI: War criminals? What are the charges?,MARRITZA: Tell me, Major; did you figure it all out by yourself, or did you need help from your Federation masters? KIRA: I'll let you wonder about that. It'll keep you occupied while we're waiting for the provisional government to prepare your war crimes tribunal. MARRITZA: War crimes? How could there be war crimes, when there wasn't any war? Of course, I can understand how you might wish there had been a war... Your need to indulge some pathetic fantasy of brave Bajoran soldiers marching to an honorable defeat. But in fact, Major, you and I both know there was no war; no glory; Bajor didn't resist. It just surrendered.","NECHEYEV: And what is that? SISKO: The Maquis. NECHEYEV: The Maquis... are a bunch of irresponsible hotheads.,MACIAS: Let's just say... we sympathize with those who oppose Cardassia. RO: Are you Maquis? MACIAS: What if we were... ?,MARTOK: Captain, my crew and I were patrolling the Cardassian border, and we intercepted a very disturbing message. SISKO: This is a Maquis code. MARTOK: I was as surprised as you. I thought the Maquis had been wiped out by Cardassia and their Dominion allies. But it would appear I was mistaken.,SISKO: And a long time after that. EDDINGTON: Until he joined the Maquis. SISKO: He betrayed his oath to Starfleet.,NECHEYEV: Don't they realize that they're jeopardizing our treaty with the Cardassians? SISKO: The Maquis never signed any treaty. NECHEYEV: What about Commander Hudson? He's lived with these people. What's his analysis of the situation?","ODO: I have no time for fantasies. QUARK: Ah. No imagination, huh? ODO: Waste of time. Too many people dream of places they'll never go, wish for things they'll never have... instead of paying adequate attention to their real lives...,SISKO: Well, can you imagine any circumstance in which the Empire would deceive the Federation? CH'POK: I have a poor imagination. SISKO: Let's see what we can do to spark it.,DATA: Yes, sir. A focal point... where all the ideas and instincts of this emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form. TROI: Almost like an ""imagination... "" TROI: Sir, I'd like to go to the Holodeck. I could interact with the characters... maybe find some clues that would help us understand what's happening.,RUMPELSTILTSKIN: A figment, am I... O'BRIEN: Just a figment of my imagination, that's all. RUMPELSTILTSKIN: And yet you can't deny how this imagination of yours empowers me, can you? Empowers me in a way that somehow terrifies you...,DAX: Good. That's what a holosuite's for. To have a good time. All you have to do is relax and use your imagination. KIRA: I guess I don't have much of an imagination. DAX: Of course you do. Everyone does. Didn't you used to play make- believe when you were a kid?,GEORDI: Well, then maybe he's in the wrong line of work. GUINAN: You engineering types don't appreciate imagination... ? GEORDI: That's not it, Guinan... he just doesn't fit in here...,TROI: Data... This is amazing. How did you come up with this? DATA: I followed your advice, Counselor. I used my imagination. TROI: That's an understatement...",,"O'BRIEN: I'm not sure that's on our list. SISKO: New Orleans is a wonderful city. EZRI: Jadzia loved Rio.,BASHIR: Where'd you learn to do that? SISKO: I used to work summers at my father's restaurant in New Orleans. KIRA: What are we having? It smells delicious.,QUARK: Oh, Moogie. I love you. SISKO: There's no place like New Orleans for simple pleasures... good food, good music... KASIDY: Sounds like a great place to grow up.,SISKO: Nathan'll be running things sooner than you think if you don't take better care of yourself. I just had a talk with your doctor. He says you haven't been to see him in eight months. JOSEPH: That man's an idiot. He's lived in New Orleans for twenty years and he can't tell the difference between Creole food and Cajun food. SISKO: Maybe not, but he can tell the difference between a healthy body and one with progressive atherosclerosis. He says if you don't come in for vascular regeneration therapy, this restaurant's going to be looking for a new owner.","TASHA: That's so beautiful. And so sad for you. You've lost everything. LUTAN: I have my honor. TASHA: It's such a... a waste!,GOWRON: Think about what you're doing. If you turn your back on me now, for as long as I live, you will not be welcome anywhere in the Klingon Empire. Your family will be removed from the High Council, your lands seized, and your House stripped of its titles. You will be left with nothing. WORF: Except my honor. GOWRON: So be it.,LESKIT : ... because he fights for his people... and he follows a code... just like we do. But not the soldiers of the Dominion... not the Jem'Hadar. They don't fight for anything... they fight because they've been designed that way... programmed to fight. ORTAKIN: They have no honor. LESKIT: You're right. And that's why they're better than us.,TROI: One can see the importance of ""honor"" here. LUTAN: Honor is everything. HAGON: There will be gifts for each of you, to absolve the abduction.,TOSK: (a formal Tosk good- bye) Die with honor, Oh Brien. O'BRIEN: Die with honor, Tosk. SISKO: Just what did happen at that security checkpoint, Chief...,RIKER: Join me. WORF: The honor is to serve. PICARD: Begin long-range scanning of all sectors within three light years of Braslota. How is your crew shaping up?,KOR: Pleasure to meet you. Any enemy of Gowron and the High Council is a friend of mine. WORF: This is a great honor. KOR: No doubt.,K'EHLEYR : You would have gone through with the oath, wouldn't you? Regardless of the consequences to our careers -- to our lives? WORF: Honor demanded no less. K'EHLEYR: I'm sick to death of Klingon ""honor."" What do you want? Is honor all you care about? Don't you feel anything else?,GEORDI: I may have no choice. WORF: You will die without honor.
