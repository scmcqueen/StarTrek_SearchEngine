I can travel along it. BEVERLY: After I light the candle, then what? RONIN: Then we'll be together... always.,RONIN: Yes... if I'm away from it for too long, I begin to weaken.

RONIN: It's not easy for me to take corporeal form... I can't do it for long. I want you to light the candle... BEVERLY: Quint said it was your home... is that true?,BEVERLY: Quint said it was your home... is that true? RONIN: Yes... if I'm away from it for too long, I begin to weaken. That's why the women in your family have always kept the candle lit. BEVERLY: The candle is on my ship... I'll go get it...,RONIN: Beverly...

But this is my house now and these are my things -- QUINT: I'm telling ya -- that candle has been a curse on your family for generations. And if you had a lick of sense, you'd listen to me right now and do away with it. Now give it to me. BEVERLY: This is a family heirloom and I intend to keep it. I would like you to leave my house. Now.,BEVERLY: I think your imagination is -- QUINT: Think what ya want, see what ya want. But just do what I say. Don't light the candle. Don't go in that house. Or before you know it... I'll be burying another Howard in this cemetery. WORF: Captain -- I am detecting atmospheric turbulence over the colony... and large pockets of electrical activity.,TROI: That's beautiful... what is it? BEVERLY: A family heirloom... it's been in the Howard clan for at least twenty generations. It's supposed to symbolize the ""enduring spirit of the Howards, wherever they may go -- a shining light to guide their fortune."" Nana always kept it lit.

If you defend yourselves, you will be punished. PICARD: Counselor. TROI: You are not dealing with an individual mind. They do not have a single leader.

Boys are raised by men, girls by women. Those poor children aren't even told the other sex exists until they're sixteen. ODO: And your child is male. LWAXANA: The day Jeyal found out, he said he was going to take the baby away from me as soon as he was born I told him that wasn't what we'd agreed to; he'd said it would be different with us because I wasn't Tavnian.,TROI: Yes, and strange to think my child is the cause.

No. We must undo the damage we've caused. Number One -- tell me about the group's leader.,SISKO: Opaka? KIRA: Our spiritual leader. She's known as the Kai.

What about Bajor? You can't tell me that Bajor doesn't concern you. You've sent the Bajorans orbs and Emissaries -- you've encouraged them to create an entire religion around you. You even told me once that you were ""of Bajor!"" So don't tell me you're not ""concerned"" with corporeal matters. SISKO: I don't want to see Bajor destroyed and neither do you. And we all know that's exactly what's going to happen if the Dominion takes over the Alpha Quadrant. You say you don't want me to sacrifice my life -- fine, neither do I.

""Q"" : YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT!,TROI: Feelings aren't positive or negative Data, they simply exist. It's what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad. For example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it.
