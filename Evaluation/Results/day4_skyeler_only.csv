What if the Federation should make peace with the Romulans someday... WORF: Impossible. RIKER: Not long ago, your people said the same thing about humans.,O'BRIEN: There's no way two different scans could have exactly the same dispersal patterns. BASHIR: It's impossible. BASHIR: Someone took Mora's results and built a phony medical workup around them. This isn't Odo's file. They sent a fake.,DUKAT: Same old Odo; like a blunt instrument. Now; to answer your question... I regret that I cannot give you access to any files on Gul Darhe'el. However, I assure you that the files would only tell you what I'm telling you... Gul Darhe'el is dead. ODO: That's impossible. DUKAT: I attended the funeral myself. As a matter of fact, he's buried under one of the largest military monuments on Cardassia.,WORF : He searched and searched the murky ocean bottom, holding his breath for three days and three nights... TOQ: That is impossible! WORF: For you, perhaps. Not for Kahless. He was a great warrior.","RIKER: I have my father to thank for that. PULASKI: Oh, your father liked to cook? RIKER: No, he hated it. It was a chore left to me.,RIKER: You're also the food taster? YUTA: That's part of the cook's duties. YUTA : I'm sure the sovereign will wish to sample many of the cuisines your ship has to offer, but there are certain Acamarian dishes she will insist upon.,SERGEY: He didn't want any human foods growing up... everything had to be Klingon... HELENA: I learned to cook rokeg blood pie... SERGEY: We never quite learned how to eat it though.,QUARK: No, this is my disruptor pistol. The one I used to carry in the old days, when I was serving on that Ferengi freighter. ODO: I thought you were the ship's cook. QUARK: That's right, and every member of that crew thought he was a food critic. If the Klingons try to get through these doors, I'll be ready for them.,JAKE: Chicken a la Sisko. JENNIFER: How did you learn to cook like that? JAKE: All Sisko men have the cooking gene. You should taste my Dad's shrimp Creole.,RIKER: 'Owon. RIKER: A cook's only as good as his ingredients. WORF: Delicious.,EZRI: He's a very good engineer. ROM: He's also a very good cook. These fried tube grubs are delicious. QUARK: Better hope he didn't poison them.,KURN: How long has the bird been dead? It appears to have been lying in the sun for some time. GEORDI: It's not really dead, it's replicated. But you do understand we... cook many of our foods... KURN: Ah yes... I was told to prepare for that... I will try some of your burned replicated bird meat.,SISKO: How did you know that? JAKE: You're cooking chicken paprikash. You only cook Hungarian food when you're in a really good mood. SISKO: I always said you were a smart kid.","RIKER: A Klingon delicacy. That's heart of targ -- this is pipius claw. And this is stewed ""gagh."" PULASKI: ""Gagh""? RIKER: Serpent worms... would you like to know how they're prepared?,KLAG: Then you'll also like this. RIKER: This is ""gagh,"" isn't it? KLAG: Very good. You did some research on our nutritional choices.,EZRI: Each containing a different variety. KIRA: There are varieties of gagh? EZRI: Oh, yes. I can remember what each one tastes like... and the way they... move when you swallow them. Torgud gagh wiggles. Filden gagh squirms. Meshta gagh jumps...,EZRI: Jadzia ordered it. She was planning a party for Martok's birthday next week. KIRA: How much gagh did she order? ODO: Fifty-one cases.,MARTOK: And these men were her friends. They honor her with their presence. QUARK: (to O'Brien and Bashir) Gagh for breakfast, gagh for lunch, gagh for dinner... am I the only one who thinks Klingon menus need to have more variety? O'BRIEN: You want to complain about the gagh, that's fine with me.,KIRA: There are varieties of gagh? EZRI: Oh, yes. I can remember what each one tastes like... and the way they... move when you swallow them. Torgud gagh wiggles. Filden gagh squirms. Meshta gagh jumps... BASHIR: You all right?,K'VADA: You'll take your meals with us... and we don't serve Federation food. PICARD: I haven't had gagh in a while... been looking forward to it. Very fresh. KLINGON COM: MeH HoD...,KIRA: I went to check the contents of that crate -- a tentacle grabbed hold of my hand. ODO: Gagh. The Klingons have been getting regular shipments since the day they were posted here. KIRA: I can't believe they eat that stuff.","QUARK: Bad? Bad?! It's twenty-one hundred hours, the bar's open, there's a sale on synthehol, and there's no one here! KOZAK: You -- Ferengi! Another blood wine! Now! ROM: At least someone is still here.","VARLEY: I know what you're thinking, what the hell am I doing here? Well, I had heard rumors about a couple of archaeological digs that started making the Iconians sound a lot less like legend. I did a little investigating, and I located their homeworld. PICARD: In the Neutral Zone. VARLEY: In the Neutral Zone.,DATA: I must leave. SONNY: What's this ""Neutral Zone?"" DATA: A buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.,TROI: The Romulans could have a cloaked base on the surface... RIKER: Or anywhere else along the Neutral Zone. WORF: Sir, a coded subspace signal from Romulus... it's the Captain...,KORRIS: We were passengers. The Talarians were taking us to outpost M-Zed-Five. PICARD: What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone? KORRIS: We were attacked without warning by a Ferengi cruiser. During the course of the battle we must have unknowingly entered the Neutral Zone.,K'VADA: Jatlh! KLINGON COM: MeHmaH ghoS... (We are approaching the Neutral Zone.) K'VADA: So'wl'chu'. (Prepare to engage the cloaking device.),TARIS: I have claimed this planet for the Romulan Empire. RIKER: This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. TARIS: You will withdraw or I will be forced to destroy your ship and your away team.","QUARK: Assassin. ROM: Tailor. ZEK: Both.,ROMULAN: That would be... Mister Garak. A cobbler, I believe... SISKO: A tailor, actually. ROMULAN: I'll correct our records. That is, if he's still alive... ?,GARAK: What you are is a great disappointment. WORF: You fight well... for a tailor. SISKO: Doctor.,GARAK: How so? O'BRIEN: That's not the face of a tailor. GARAK: I'm not a tailor. Not for the moment anyway.,GARAK: I suppose not. GUL TORAN: Go back to your sewing kit, tailor. GARAK: Some people should never be promoted.,GARAK: I don't know what you're talking about. QUARK: Oh, yes you do. You weren't always a tailor. GARAK: You're right. I used to be a gardener. Now, if you have something you want weeded, you let me know.,O'BRIEN: That's not the face of a tailor. GARAK: I'm not a tailor. Not for the moment anyway. BOQ'TA: You know, I once bought a suit from Garak. Turned out the sleeves were a little long. I remember being angry when I brought it in to be fixed.,GARAK,: Let me tell you a story. I once knew a Cardassian, a dashing, handsome young man with a promising career. And then one day, through no fault of his own, he found himself exiled and alone, with nowhere to turn. But did he give up? No. Instead he struck upon a brilliant plan. Rather than fleeing for the rest of his life, he sought shelter in the one place no one expected him to go. In a stronghold of his people's most hated enemies. There, surrounded by hostile strangers, he built a life. And there, against all odds, against the merciless logic of the Universe itself, he thrived. ZIYAL: By becoming the greatest tailor in the Galaxy. GARAK: The moral, my dear, is to never underestimate my gift for survival.,SISKO: I think it's time we had a little talk with Garak... GARAK: But who would want to kill me... a simple tailor? ODO: A simple tailor who used to be an agent of the Obsidian Order.,GARAK: Oh? Then what can I do for you? QUARK: I want to hire you. Not as a tailor... as an assassin. GARAK: I don't know what you're talking about.,TAIN: It's been a long time, Elim... TAIN: So... you're a tailor, now. Is this one of your creations? GARAK: A minor example of my work...,ODO: I tend to agree. But I think he would approve of... a tailor's shop. GARAK: You know what the sad part is, Odo... I'm a pretty good tailor. ODO: Garak... I was thinking that... we should have breakfast together... sometime.,GARAK: But who would want to kill me... a simple tailor? ODO: A simple tailor who used to be an agent of the Obsidian Order. GARAK: The Obsidian Order? Constable, you shouldn't put so much stock in Doctor Bashir's flights of fancy. Are you sure the explosion wasn't an accident, because I can't think of anyone who would wish me harm...","TROI: He tried to tell me about it before, in my office. I misunderstood, I thought he was talking about thoughts she was keeping private. What he meant was that something was happening in her meta-conscious mind. BEVERLY: Meta-conscious? TROI: It's a part of the Betazoid psyche. A kind of... filtering mechanism to protect us from psychic trauma.,RIKER: Geordi?! Are you conscious? GEORDI: Do I look conscious? RIKER: No. What are you doing?,RIKER/DATA : Geordi! RIKER: Geordi?! Are you conscious? GEORDI: Do I look conscious?,GARAK: I couldn't agree more. BASHIR: There's a high level of neural activity... which suggests their conscious minds are active... but there's no response to any external stimuli. BASHIR: What's the word on the runabout?","KIRA: There's a peace treaty. HELER: You mean the Occupation is over? DUKAT: I need to find the girl. Tell me where she is.,BASHIR: Good. In the meantime... I have some reading to do. SISKO: This is Terok Nor... D.S. Nine during the occupation. DAX: Time travel?,DUKAT: It wasn't like that. Naprem and I... loved each other. KIRA: The head of the Occupation in love with a Bajoran? DUKAT: Ironic, isn't it?,DUKAT: I appreciate the awkwardness of your position, Commander. This Bajoran obsession with alleged Cardassian improprieties during the occupation, is really quite distasteful. SISKO: I suppose if you're a Bajoran, so was the occupation. DUKAT: I remind you that neither one of us is Bajoran. I'd hate their bitterness to cause conflict between Cardassia and the Federation.,KIRA: I heard about the list... ... the one that Quark got out of the wall... ODO: Rom said it had been hidden there during the occupation. KIRA: I couldn't help wondering if it had... something to do with Vaatrik...,WEYOUN: Please tell me you're not that naive. JAKE: But I only stayed here so I could report on the occupation. WEYOUN: You see, there you go again. This isn't an occupation. This is a Cardassian station. I'm sure you're aware that there are no Dominion troops on Bajor. And why should there be? We have a treaty with them. They're our friends.,DUKAT: I know what you're thinking. But really, what good would it do to try to kill me? Even if you succeeded, it wouldn't get you off Empok Nor. You'd only be making me a martyr. DUKAT: If it wasn't for me, the occupation would've been much worse. KIRA: And you want a thank you? You were working people to death in the ore processing centers, but that didn't stop you from strutting around Terok Nor, picking out Bajoran women to take to your bed. And actually believing they wanted to be there.,KIRA: No. I guess I don't. ZIYAL: I understand. He did some very bad things during the occupation. KIRA: Yes he did.,ODO: (ignoring her, full of steam) Give me the right to set a curfew, let me do more searches of arriving passengers, give me fifty more deputies... KIRA: And this station will be just like it was during the occupation... ODO: Say what you will, it was safer then.,GUL DUKAT: We can't have these Bajorans running around, murdering each other. I'm talking about order. Justice. ODO: There is very little justice in the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. GUL DUKAT: (breaking character, harsh) Don't push me, Odo.

But I'm not responsible for the Occupation, the Prophets are.,DUKAT: I must say, I've always admired Shakaar's success with women. The intelligence file I kept on him during the occupation was filled with reports of his conquests. In fact, if you remember correctly, you were the only female in his resistance cell that he didn't ""charm""... at least until now. KIRA: Is that what you kept track of during the occupation? No wonder you lost. DUKAT: A little more wine, Major?,AKOREM : Priests have become merchants... farmers have become politicians. AKOREM: We must heal the wounds of the occupation... we must return to our D'jarras... AKOREM: We must reclaim what we were... and follow the path the Prophets have laid out for us... it is their will that the farmers return to their land, painters to their canvasses, priests to their temples...,RAZKA: Let's just say I miss the old days on Bajor. Smuggling may not've been the safest line of work, but it was a lot more exciting than selling scrap metal. KIRA: I think you're the only Bajoran I know who actually misses the occupation.

JAKE: It won't do any good to lie about it, Nog.,JAKE: This Emissary stuff. It scares me a little. SISKO: Jake. JAKE.: Twice now, twice in one year -- Doctor Bashir's called me down to the Infirmary to tell me something was wrong with you.
