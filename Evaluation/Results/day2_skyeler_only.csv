On her balcony."" BEVERLY: An image of romance. TROI: Exactly. Image is everything to the Tamarians.,ODO: Sir? SISKO: A little romance, Odo. ODO: I have six pylons that need a complete security sweep... I don't have time for romantic interludes... frankly, in my humble opinion, most of you humanoids spend far too much time on your respective mating rituals...,KIRA: Maybe you should finish it. ODO: Why waste my time? Romance is for solids. KIRA: You are solid... at least eighteen hours a day. I'm sure there're plenty of woman on this station who'd be interested in you if you gave them half a chance.,KIRA: No, it's lovely. I just can't accept it. ZEK: Then I suppose a night of wild passionate romance is out of the question. KIRA: That's right.,DAX: (reacts, a beat, shakes her head) Julian... DAX: It's time I explain that Trills don't look for romance the way humans do. DAX : In fact, we consider it quite a nuisance.,MELORA: It's pretty. MELORA: Tell me something, Lieutenant... you think there's room for... romance... in Starfleet? DAX: I think so.,DAX: ... you could say that. MELORA: I finish my mission here... I move on to the next one... what kind of future is that for a romance? DAX: Look at the alternative.,SISKO: ... without injuring yourselves? DAX: Interspecies romance isn't without it's dangers. That's part of the fun. Maybe we'll have better luck on Risa. SISKO: Risa? I thought you and Worf were going to take your vacation on Earth.,WORF: Do not think of this as a performance. Believe in where you are... put yourself in this time and place... WORF: A thousand years ago... the dawn of the Empire. Five hundred warriors storm the Great Hall at Qam-Chee. The city garrison fled before them. Only the Emperor Kahless... And the Lady Lukara stood their ground. It was here that they began the greatest romance in Klingon history. QUARK: This is ridiculous! I'm surrounded by corpses, my shoes are dripping with blood, and you want me to feel romantic? Why am I putting myself through this?","JAKE: It's a Klingon bachelor party -- use your imagination. WORF: Now begins the trial of blood... MARTOK: Let rivers flow from our veins...,Q: I'll answer any ten questions that call for a ""yes"" or a ""no."" Well? PICARD: Are you putting mankind on trial again? Q: No.,PICARD: I sincerely hope this is the last time I'll find myself here. Q: You just don't get it, do you, Jean-Luc? The trial never ends. Q: We wanted to see if you had the ability to expand your mind and your horizons... and for one brief moment, you did.,MANDARIN-BAILIFF: Stand respectfully. All present, respectfully stand! ""Q"" : This trial is adjourned to allow the criminals to be tested. MANDARIN-BAILIFF: This honorable court is adjourned!",,"WESLEY: He's coming with me to starbase. Just the two of us. Nearly a six-hour transit. What am I going to talk to him about for six hours? SONYA: Archaeology...semantics... literature... art... you can learn a lot from Captain Picard. GEORDI: Nice day for a little trip, Captain?,VASH: I don't suppose you ever heard of Professor Samuel Estragon? PICARD: As a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his life searching for the Uthat. Archaeology is a hobby of mine. VASH: I served as his personal assistant for the past five years. Shortly before he died, he uncovered new data pinpointing its location. That disc contains his research notes and maps.,WESLEY: (responding to Picard's enthusiasm and echoing it) How did you find out about all this? PICARD: Archaeology has been a hobby since my Academy days. But why don't we talk about what really brought you here? WESLEY: I can't stop thinking about the Yamato. All those people -- dead. I just don't know how you do it. You, Commander Riker, Geordi, you all handle it so easily.,MADRED: Let's not waste time arguing about issues we can't resolve. Would you care to tour the Hebitian burial vaults? MADRED: Even though they've been stripped of funerary regalia, the tomb paintings are extraordinary. Any student of archaeology would be thrilled. PICARD: What I would like... is to be returned to my ship.,MADRED: Please... let me remove those restraints. MADRED: I understand that you are a student of archaeology. Did you know that Cardassia boasts some of the most ancient and splendid ruins anywhere in the galaxy? PICARD: I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitian civilization are said to be magnificent.,GALEN: I am currently on an expedition. A journey into unexplored historical territory. And I intend to take you with me. PICARD : Captain's log, supplemental. It has been over thirty years since I last saw my archaeology professor. His presence has taken me back to a time when I had considered a very different career... GALEN: I read your paper on the Kea Four excavation that you delivered at last year's symposium. It was... informative.","DANILO: What are you going to do about the other colony? PICARD: Other colony? PICARD : Captain's log, supplemental. A review of stellar charts has revealed a Class M planet, NB2323 only half a light year from the Bringloid system. I am gambling it was the destination of the second colony.,PICARD: Asylum? GEORDI: She wants to leave the colony. RIKER: She may not be the only one. The science teams working on the surface... fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were more than curious about what's outside their world...,EDOLORD : BUT YOU DID MORE AT THE WORLD YOU JUST LEFT. WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR OWN LIFE FORMS THERE? DATA: The colony we just planted, sir... PICARD: We found that world uninhabited. The life forms we left there... (carefully choosing his words) ... had sought the challenge... ... at least that's the basic reason... had sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle, a new society there. All life on our world is driven to... to protect its own form by re-seeding itself as... as widely as possible.,ODO: Whatever you call it, the truth isn't in you. CRODEN: From the colony of changelings. DAX: We're in orbit.,TROI: It was a better approach than asking you to allow hundreds of condemned prisoners on board... PICARD: Then, this moon is a penal colony... TROI: That is correct. But now we have your ship... and your bodies to carry us home...,KEVIN: Very well. For what it's worth. I am a Douwd... an immortal being of disguises and false surroundings. I have lived in this galaxy for many thousands of years although until today no one has known my true identity. Once while traveling in human form I chanced to fall in love with an Earth woman. I put aside my powers and became her husband. Our life was happy and rich. Eventually we came to this planet to live our final years. Now she is dead. She never knew what I really was... PICARD: Your colony was attacked by a warship... KEVIN: Belonging to the Husnock, a species of hideous intelligence that knew only aggression and destruction. I could have destroyed them with a mere thought, but this I did not do.,GOSHEVEN: Hyperonic radiation took the lives of a third of the colonists before they learned they could adapt to it. KENTOR: But the colony survived -- and prospered. GOSHEVEN: Look around. We've brought water to the desert, built a community.","PICARD: Two Federation outposts in Sector three-zero have been destroyed. There has been no communication with any Federation starbases in Sector three-one since stardate 41903.2. WORF: Romulans. PICARD: That is the assumption.,GEORDI: I think we could narrow the list down with a little common sense, Data... ask yourself who has the most to gain from a conflict between the Klingon Empire and the Federation? GEORDI: -- the Romulans. GEORDI: They fashioned a perfect Federation rifle... but they had to charge it from their energy sources. So the discharge crystal and the emission beam pattern correspond to those you'd find in a Romulan disrupter.,BASHIR: It'll buy us time to rebuild our defenses. And it'll give us a chance to bring the Romulans into the alliance. SISKO: The Romulans? BASHIR: According to our analysis, they'll vote to abandon their non-aggression pact with the Dominion at next year's plenary session.,PICARD: The Duras family is preparing to move against Gowron. RIKER: Backed by Romulans? PICARD: I don't know. But there's too much history between the Duras and the Romulans to discount the possibility.,ROSS: Then it's settled. Good luck, General. Good luck to us all. LETANT: Romulans don't believe in luck. MARTOK: All the better. That leaves more for the rest of us.","O'BRIEN: Who has time for sleep... ? SISKO: Coffee. O'BRIEN: I'd settle for five minutes of peace and quiet.,COMPUTER: Diagnostic cycle will be complete in twenty seconds. GEORDI: Iced coffee. GEORDI: What is it, girl?,QUARK: Excuse me, gentlemen. O'BRIEN: Is that coffee? QUARK: I figured you were working on a way to help Odo. I thought it was the least I could do.,BASHIR: Are you listening to me? O'BRIEN: Yes. Coffee, music, stars. BASHIR: Well, don't you have anything to say?,O'BRIEN: You know, I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee right now... KEIKO: Miles -- you never drink coffee in the afternoon -- O'BRIEN: Sure I do.,KEIKO: I know my husband. He never drank coffee that late in the day. KIRA: Maybe he's not drinking coffee. Maybe it's tea... KEIKO: I checked the data clip and it contained a spectroscopic analysis. The liquid in Miles' cup consisted of vegetable-based oils and caffeine... it's coffee all right...","RIKER: Stand-by, La Forge... WESLEY: The saucer section... it's a sitting duck... RIKER: Prepare to draw their fire...,PICARD: Attention bridge. Print-out message, urgent, to all decks. (selecting the right words) All stations on all decks, make ready to detach ship's saucer section. PICARD: You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant. WORF: I am a Klingon, sir. For me to seek escape while my captain goes into battle....,SHELBY: There's one other recommendation I'd like to make, Commander. Separate the saucer section... assign a skeleton crew to create a diversion... RIKER: We may need power from the saucer impulse engines... SHELBY: But it would give them more than one target to worry about.,PICARD: Note in ship's log that at this startime, I am transferring command to the Battle Bridge. Make the signal, Data. PICARD: Captain's log, stardate 42354.1. Preparing to detach saucer section. PICARD: ... so that families and the majority of the ship's company...","RIKER: Where are you going, Captain? PICARD: To the bridge. RIKER: I can't let you do that, sir.","DAX : What's so interesting in there? ARJIN: I can see my future. DAX: I wouldn't trust a bottle of synthale to tell you the future.,DATA: Circumstances demand that I take you into my confidence. I require your assistance. DATA: I am from the future. GUINAN: Is this some kind of a joke?,BASHIR: Who told you that? O'BRIEN: You did. In the future. BASHIR: Oh... Who am I to argue with me?,BAREIL: ""Orb?"" KIRA: A gift from the Prophets. It can foresee the future -- or a possible future, anyway. BAREIL: That could come in handy. Who are the Prophets?,GUINAN : Looked like quite an intense discussion. GEORDI: Yeah... talking about life, death, the future... GUINAN: Somebody getting married?,QUARK: I would consider it a privilege. And the purpose of this conference... ? ZEK: The future. And for Ferengi business interests the future is already here. And its name is the Gamma Quadrant. O'BRIEN: Alright, class please turn on your computers. Jake, Luta, I want to see your algebra homework.,SISKO: I was standing in front of the Obelisk. And as I looked up, for a moment, I understood it all. B'hala... the Orbs... the occupation... the discovery of the wormhole... the coming war with the Dominion. KIRA: You could see the future as well as the past? SISKO: And for one moment, I could see the pattern that held it all together.,BRUNT: Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes -- it's disgusting. ISHKA: Get used to it, limp lobes. This is the future. BRUNT: Over my dead body.","DATA: When Counselor Troi is in an unhappy mood, she often has something chocolate... Q: Chocolate... DATA: For example, a hot fudge sundae. I cannot speak from personal experience, but I have seen it often has a profound psychological impact.,RIKER: Sure. I'll catch up with you later. RIKER: Chocolate ice cream. Chocolate fudge. Chocolate chips. You're not depressed, are you? TROI: I'm fine, Commander.,RIKER: I never knew it was a ritual. TROI: Chocolate is a serious thing. RIKER: You know... I brought something back from Risa. It's better than chocolate.,WORF: I believe Commander Data's painting is making me dizzy... WORF: I thought this cake was chocolate... TROI: Don't I wish.,RIKER: I don't like fudge. TROI: Really. I never met a chocolate I didn't like. RIKER: Doesn't it taste good?,TROI: Transfer my mother's letters to my viewer... TROI : ... and computer, I'd like a... a real chocolate sundae. COMPUTER: Define ""real"" in context, please.","KAHLESS: I have returned because there is a great need in my people... they fight among themselves in petty wars and corrupt the glory of the Klingon spirit.

(All hail Kahless) CROWD: Vorcha-doh-baghk, Kahless!,KOROTH: Who are you? DIVOK: It is Kahless! KAHLESS: I have returned.,KOROTH : But we did not have the technology to bring you back until now. We were able to use an organic sample of the first Kahless to... give you life. KAHLESS: The first Kahless? WORF: A clone. He is a clone.,WORF: Kahless himself was not high- born. MARTOK: Kahless was divine. WORF: Your name is revered throughout the Empire. If you seize the Leadership, every warrior from here to Kronos will swear an oath to you. With that kind of support, the High Council will have no choice but to accept you as chancellor.,KOR: More revered than Sabak's armor, and more coveted than the Emperor's crown!
