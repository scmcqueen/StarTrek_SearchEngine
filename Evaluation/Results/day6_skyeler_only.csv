TRAVELER: I am -- a Traveler. PICARD: A traveler? What is your destination?,JAKE: Forget it Nog, we have to tell him. We've been investigating the man whose picture you're holding in your hand right now. Until yesterday, that man, one ""Willie Mays"" did not exist in any historical documents. Then, in the blink of an eye, that card appeared on the station, and at the same moment, a bust of Willie Mays appeared at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. There's only one explanation. (beat, then points to the card) We suspect that this man... is from the future. WEYOUN: A time-traveler? JAKE: That's right. And so far that card is our only link to him. We have to find out what he's planning to do in the past. ... or what he may have done already.,GEORDI: Or whatever you want to call it, Data. I don't have a name for it. RIKER: The Traveler's gone, sir. PICARD: Gone?,TRAVELER: I am -- a Traveler. PICARD: A traveler? What is your destination? TRAVELER: Destination?,RIKER: There is no evidence either way. PICARD: The Traveler moved through time with the power of his mind. RIKER: I don't think that's the case here.,TRAVELER: I will try. PICARD: Number One, you'll take the Traveler to Main Engineering; I'll be on the bridge... WESLEY: He is very weak.,TRAVELER: It's nothing I can tell you, Wesley... WESLEY: Then how am I supposed to do it? (off the Traveler's even stare) You said you'd help. TRAVELER: You must allow me to help.,BEVERLY: I don't suppose you remember an alien from Tau Alpha C who was once onboard... called himself a Traveler... ? BEVERLY: Jean-Luc, I don't know how, but you and I must find this Traveler or another from his race... if anyone can help us... PICARD: You have my word... as soon as we return to the starbase, I'll make every effort to find him.,PICARD: ... OF YOUR STRENGTH. URGENT. THIS IS AN ORDER. YOU MUST TRY TO DO THIS. PICARD: YOU WILL ATTEMPT NOW TO CONCENTRATE COMPLETELY ON EITHER YOUR DUTY OF THE MOMENT... OR UPON THE TRAVELER... ON HIS WELL BEING. PICARD: THINK OF HIM AS SOMEONE YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT.,BEVERLY: Who? WESLEY: He was Kosinski's assistant... an alien from Tau Alpha C... He said he was a ""Traveler""... somehow he combined warp technology with the energy of his own thoughts... BEVERLY: Yes, I remember... he took us where thoughts and reality became indistinguishable... Wesley, is it possible you've accidentally re-created something he did? Something that could alter reality?,TRAVELER: There's still a way. PICARD : Captain's log, Stardate 44162.5. Two attempts to retrieve Doctor Crusher have failed. And now the Traveler, a mysterious visitor from our past, has reappeared. WESLEY: And then I sent a message by subspace to Tau Alpha C asking for help... but I didn't think it would reach there for days...,RIKER: He phased completely out of existence... at least out of our existence. PICARD: Attention all decks. This is to inform you that the Traveler has left us. With your support, he has returned us to our galaxy. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well. PICARD: Have the boy come up on the bridge, Number One.,COMPUTER: There is no Tau Alpha C listed on current star maps... PICARD : Captain's log, stardate 44162.8. At the direction of the Traveler, the Enterprise is returning to Starbase One-Three-Three and the precise position where the subspace bubble was formed. TRAVELER: Our goal will be to create a stable gateway between our reality and your mother's reality...,PICARD : ... but wish one variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the Enterprise. We have no idea exactly how this works... PICARD : ... we understand only that the Traveler makes use of this somehow. It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what we're attempting to do. PICARD: Any further advice, Counselor?,COMPUTER: Three minutes thirty seconds to life support failure. BEVERLY: (to herself, quick pace, pressing herself to complete equation) The Traveler used his thoughts to alter warp fields... and thoughts became reality... Now I'm in a warp field... Could my thoughts have changed this reality? BEVERLY: Come on, Beverly! What's the next step?! What was I thinking at the moment Wesley's bubble formed? Dalen Quaice... He said... all the people he'd known were gone... I thought of Jack... I went to see Wesley... the flash in Engineering... And that's when it started... when I started losing everybody! My thoughts created this universe. Can they get me out of it again?,PICARD: ALL DECKS, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING. ALL DECKS... PICARD: ... I MUST HAVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION. IN A FEW MOMENTS AS WE ATTEMPT TO WARP BACK HOME, IT IS VITAL... ABSOLUTELY VITAL, THAT YOU CENTER YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOUR DUTY... OR UPON THE WELFARE OF THE ONE CALLED 'THE TRAVELER.' THINK OF GIVING HIM SOME... PICARD: ... OF YOUR STRENGTH. URGENT. THIS IS AN ORDER. YOU MUST TRY TO DO THIS.","WORF: I detect no shields, no weapons of any known design. PICARD: Hailing frequencies.

BASHIR: To friendship.,GUINAN: We... become friends... PICARD: It goes beyond friendship. GUINAN: But... I have to wait... almost five hundred years... And when we meet... I won't be able to tell you about this, will I?,KAZAGO: We are not selling it to him? BOK: Call it an act of friendship. RATA: At no cost!? Ugly. Very ugly!,PEL: I see. QUARK: ""Never place friendship above profit."" PEL: The twenty-first Rule of Acquisition.,GOWRON: Yes, yes. I know you did what you thought was right. And even though you may have made some enemies, I assure you I am not one of them. WORF: I'm glad. Your friendship means much to me. GOWRON: And yours to me. It has been too long since you last fought at my side. But now the time has come again. We will do great deeds in the coming days. Deeds worthy of song.,PICARD: Why? DATA: It is a reminder of friendship and service. PICARD: (lifts out the holocube, and triggers it; Tasha stands before them) And this? You have no portraits of any other of your crewmates. Why this person?,TROI: And you are about to put your career at risk for him. PICARD: Isn't that what friendship's all about, Counselor? TROI: -- They illicitly used the emergency channel to draw you here. Then they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors. Effectively, to disobey Starfleet regulations.,WORF: Aye, sir. DATA: Mister Worf... I am sorry if I have ended our friendship. WORF: Sir... it is I who has jeopardized our friendship, not you. If you will... overlook this incident, I would like to continue to consider myself your friend.,DATA: I am going to miss her, Captain. PICARD: That too is part of friendship, remembrance and regrets. DATA: Yes, sir.,GUINAN: Shut up, kid. Now, tell me more about my eyes. TROI: He's relaxed... experiencing feelings of warmth. Friendship. PULASKI: He's reliving memories. That's a natural side effect of the neural stimulation.","ODO: How do you feel -- better? ODO: I realize you can't understand a word I'm saying, but that doesn't matter. I know you're aware of me. You see, I was once like you. I spent months in a lab being poked and prodded by a scientist who didn't even realize I was a lifeform. I was just a specimen, a mystery that needed to be unraveled. He never talked to me. It didn't occur to him. I didn't know what I was, or what I was supposed to do. I was lost, alone. ODO: But it's not going to be that way for you. I'm not going to make the same mistakes that were made with me.","JAKE: Really? SISKO: It'll be like a vacation. A working vacation. JAKE: That's fantastic. Thanks, Dad. I bet we'll have a great time.,JARADAN: You have... honored us with your words of greeting. A new day dawns between us. RIKER: So... Have a nice vacation? PICARD: It was a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to die there.,LEETA: I can't believe we finally made it. BASHIR: Well, enjoy your vacation. LEETA: We will.,SISKO: What's going on? Why's the restaurant closed? JOSEPH: I'm going on vacation. To Tyree. JAKE: We're coming with you, Dad.,QUARK: Excuse me, but I believe I ordered a snail juice. Hand-squeezed. LEETA: Get it yourself. I'm on vacation. QUARK: How much longer until we get there?,FULLERTON: Don't you walk away from me. WORF: I'll do as I please. I'm on vacation. QUARK: Figures. The weather improves the day we leave.,BASHIR: Bring him over here. O'BRIEN: Some romantic vacation I took you on... KEIKO: We'll get another chance...,WORF : A swirling mass of color, set against a background of glowing clouds and burning sky. It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw... until now. DAX: I've got to take you on vacation more often. WOMAN: Dax? Is that you?,RIKER: Strictly pleasure. I've built up about three months worth of leave and Doctor Crusher finally insisted that I take some of it. In fact, she nearly shoved me out the airlock. SISKO: D.S. Nine isn't exactly known as a vacation getaway. RIKER: I'm actually just passing through on my way to Risa. The last time I was here, I only got to spend two hours at Quark's... but by the time I left, I had all his latinum and a date with one of his dabo girls. I thought I might try my luck again.","DUKAT: False. I tried to save lives during my administration. SISKO: Evidence? DUKAT: Evidence? He wants evidence. By the time I became Prefect, the occupation had been going on for almost forty years, but the planet was still not ready for full-scale colonization. Central Command wanted the situation resolved and they didn't care how it was done. I was convinced that a gentler hand was required to deal with the Bajorans.,QUINN: Something or someone is trying to destroy the fabric of all we've built over the last two hundred years. PICARD: What's your evidence? QUINN: I can't go into that. Too many other people are involved. But if we're right, this is the most critical time in the history of the Federation.,KELL: The Governor of Krios has charged that the Federation is secretly aiding the rebels. RIKER: Does he have evidence? KELL: The Council has sent me to examine his evidence. It was my decision, Captain Picard, to ask you to accompany me. You are respected by many on the council.,LURSA: That is outrageous. B'ETOR: What is this evidence? RIKER: Beam over and we'll show you.,ODO: I certainly hope so. Smuggling with intent to supply a terrorist organization is a serious offense. SISKO: Where's your evidence? ODO: Five months ago, Captain Yates was hired by the Bajorans to carry cargo to their outlying colonies. one of her regular runs is between Bajor and the colony on Dreon Seven. It's a twelve-hour run for most ships, but she always takes eighteen. The six hour difference is just enough time to allow her to make a side trip into the Badlands, rendezvous with a Maquis ship and then continue on to the Dreon System.,ADMIRAL SATIE: Nonsense. Let's keep our priorities straight... the important thing is to uncover the conspiracy on this ship... and to prevent further damage. If Tarses is a possible saboteur, you cannot allow him access to the sensitive areas of the ship. And... I strongly suggest continuous surveillance. PICARD: If we had better evidence... ADMIRAL SATIE: We will have better evidence... Sabin and Worf are continuing to investigate... but if you don't act until then... it may be too late.,PICARD: Are you suggesting there is a conscious mind at work here? RIKER: There is no evidence either way. PICARD: The Traveler moved through time with the power of his mind.,KUBUS: He looked very upset. The next morning, Bek hung himself. KIRA: That's all the evidence you have? KUBUS: Isn't that enough? Bek was obviously working with Bareil. When he realized the enormity of what he'd done, he must've wanted to confess. Bareil wouldn't allow it, so Bek took the only way out he had.,ODO: One possibility is that the Romulans hired the Flaxian to kill Garak... and then killed the Flaxian after he failed in his mission. DAX: Do you have any evidence of that? ODO: It's only supposition, but it does fit the available facts.,LEMEC: Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Worf, and Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on Celtris Three, attacked one of our outposts in a brutal assault, and killed over fifty-five men, women and children. JELLICO: What evidence do you have of that? LEMEC: We have all the evidence we need... we have Captain Picard.,GEORDI: Without something else to cross-reference, it would take weeks to try and identify them... DATA: Fortunately, there is more evidence... DATA: We have been able to determine that the footprints we found by the shuttle were not made by any known Tarchannen life form.,BEVERLY: That's true... for now. This could be the first stage of a condition which may begin to affect your mind as well. YOUNG PICARD: But you've seen no evidence of that? BEVERLY: Not yet. What I do know is that the Captain of this ship has just gone through an extreme physical transformation... the ultimate effects of which I can't even begin to guess.,SISKO: I'm aware of that. But I have reason to believe a Dominion warfleet may be in the Alpha Quadrant headed for Earth. JARESH-INYO: Do you have evidence to back that up? SISKO: Just before we left Deep Space Nine, the wormhole was exhibiting some unusual behavior... opening and closing for no apparent reason.","WEYOUN: Really, Damar... I hope you won't allow that Cardassian-sized ego of yours to spoil our victory. And I do mean ""our victory."" Yours... mine... DAMAR: And the Breen. WEYOUN: Yes, and the Breen.,DAMAR: And the Breen. WEYOUN: Yes, and the Breen. DAMAR: We're just one big, happy family, aren't we?,EZRI: I couldn't get away... every time I looked back they were right behind me... Then one of them grabbed me with this big claw. WORF: Breen do not have claws. EZRI: How do you know? Besides, it was a dream. Dreams are full of things that don't seem to make sense.,GARAK: What about the others? Have you tested them as well? BASHIR: Everyone except the Breen. BASHIR: No blood.,EZRI: Careful. WORF: These Breen are without honor. EZRI: Why don't you sit down -- eat something?,FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: And so they shall. WEYOUN: But you just promised the Breen... FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: I'd promise the Breen the entire Alpha Quadrant if I thought it would help win this war.,DUKAT: Gather as many prisoners as you can. Have them meet us here. KIRA: How many Breen guards are there? HELER: I'm not sure. There are always at least eight in the mines.,SISKO: Dax -- we need some support from our attack fighters. NOG: Breen ship off the starboard aft. EZRI: Sir -- most of our fighters are either destroyed or under attack themselves.,KIRA: Take a look. DUKAT: The Breen? What are they doing here? KIRA: My tricorder's picking up a large concentration of dilithium in this area. They must be using the survivors from the Ravinok to mine the ore.,ODO: Thank you. KIRA: Starfleet Intelligence says that a contingent of Breen engineers arrived on Kelvas Five last week. Breen engineers... Have we had any reports of Breen ships in that system? GARAK: No. As a matter of fact, no Breen ships have been reported in that entire sector.,QUARK: You certainly did. ZEK: The state of the trade negotiations with the Breen... ZEK : ... why I dumped our lokar bean investments... why I insisted we buy up every bit of jevonite we could get our hands on.,BASHIR: The lock's not that complex. What are you doing up? O'BRIEN: I was running another power test on the Breen weapon. BASHIR: I was trying to read, but I found myself reading the same page over and over again.,EZRI: Algae paste. My favorite. EZRI: I wonder what the Breen look like under those helmets... WORF: They say that no one has ever seen one and lived to speak of it.,JEM'HADAR OFFICER: What do you see? FEMALE ROMULAN: My people have a saying. Never turn your back on a Breen. GARAK: Doctor, would you please keep the noise down. I'm trying to work in here.,WEYOUN: He says you need to get your universal translator adjusted. DAMAR: I would've -- if I had known we were meeting with the Breen. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: It is a distinct pleasure to finally meet you.","RIKER: It's all right, take it easy. GEORDI: (stares at Soong and recognizes him) It's Noonian Soong. RIKER: That's impossible.

SOONG: I programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might have -- I'm Noonian Soong; I created her. DATA: I am Data.,SOONG: Tell me, do I look somewhat familiar to you? DATA: You do bear a resemblance to Doctor Noonian Soong, the cyberneticist who constructed me. But, Doctor Soong was killed shortly afterward by the Crystalline Entity. SOONG: (laughs softly to himself) It's your lucky day, Data. You've found your long lost father, and he's alive. What do you think of that?,RIKER: Who built you, Data? DATA: Doctor Noonien Soong. RIKER: And he was?,GRAVES: Functional... Durable... Obviously no concern whatsoever for aesthetic values. GRAVES: Looks like Soong's work. DATA: Quite correct, sir! Did you know Soong?,DATA: I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavala during the period in question. DATA: O'Donnell, Juliana... Soong, Noonian -- they were both passengers on a transport that travelled from Omicron Theta to Mavala... and returned four days later. GEORDI: That sure seems to fit her story.,DATA: That cannot be correct. I have a memory record for that period of time. I can recall a series of images. DATA: I saw Doctor Soong... my father. GEORDI: I can't find anything wrong with your positronic sub-processors... or with your controllers...,GRAVES: Looks like Soong's work. DATA: Quite correct, sir! Did you know Soong? GRAVES: Know him?! I taught him everything he knows. You could say I was the father of his work... (smiles as thought occurs) Which kinda makes me your grandfather, doesn't it sonny?,JULIANA: Oh, Data, I was there -- right from the beginning, on Omicron Theta. I helped create you. And now... look at you. DATA: You were a colleague of Doctor Soong? JULIANA: Yes, I certainly was -- and I was also his wife. In a way, I suppose you could say -- I'm your mother.,GEORDI: (stares at Soong and recognizes him) It's Noonian Soong. RIKER: That's impossible. Soong's dead. (he continues to check out Soong) I think it's okay to move him. GEORDI: Look at this stuff. I'm telling you. It's Soong.,SOONG: Go, Data. Go with your friends. DATA: May I say goodbye to Doctor Soong, sir? DATA: Alone, sir?,DATA: ... except for an impression that this was a... ""Doctor Soong's"" work area. RIKER: Who? You can't mean Doctor Noonien Soong? DATA: He was called that here... although, his memories indicate he traveled here under a different name.,RIKER: That's impossible. Soong's dead. (he continues to check out Soong) I think it's okay to move him. GEORDI: Look at this stuff. I'm telling you. It's Soong. RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.,LORE: What information are you requesting? DATA: Everything available on a Doctor Noonien Soong. LORE: Good old ""Often-Wrong Soong."" A joke, brother. Actually, he was a genius by human standards.,RIKER: All he wanted to know about was previous starships. What I thought was innovative on the last Enterprise or the one before that. He said he wanted to see how well we ""grasped the fundamentals."" DATA: His queries to me primarily focused on Doctor Soong's...

O'BRIEN: I'm picking up an increase in neutrino levels. Something coming through. DAX: Shields fully charged.,KIRA: Let me know if you find anything else. DAX: Sensors are reading elevated neutrino levels at the wormhole... Something's coming through... KIRA: On screen.,SISKO: I am Commander Benjamin Sisko of the United Federation of Planets...

DAX: They're due in eight hours... (her attention's drawn to a panel) I'm reading elevated neutrino levels from the wormhole. KIRA: Hail them.,PREN: Activate the drone.
