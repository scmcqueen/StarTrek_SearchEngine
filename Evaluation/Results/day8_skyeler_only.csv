(sees the Traveler, reacts) You...,GEORDI: Here's what the computer recorded. WESLEY: This is the static warp field we created inside the warp drive. The experiment was designed to see if we could keep a bubble like this intact. GEORDI: As you'll see in a moment, we couldn't.,RIKER: Geordi, we're in position... your status? GEORDI: The warp bubble is contracting at a rate of fifteen meters per second... we'll lose it in about four minutes... TRAVELER: It's time, Wesley.,COMPUTER: Two minutes thirty seconds to life support failure. BEVERLY: Computer, hypothetical situation... a person is trapped inside a static warp bubble.

COMPUTER: Escape would theoretically depend on establishing a stable threshold between the warp field and the outer environment.,BEVERLY: Computer, give me a graphic representation of the universe. BEVERLY: I've seen that before... Wesley's experiment... the bubble. Of course... But that would mean I'm the one trapped in the bubble... BEVERLY: Computer, what's happening?,GEORDI: No, sir. PICARD: And this bubble never expanded beyond Engineering? WESLEY: Nossir.,GEORDI: Well, there's nothing there now. And no sign there ever was. PICARD: Is there any possible connection to Mister Crusher's experiment... could this warp bubble be... floating around the ship perhaps... GEORDI: No, sir. The bubble was definitely contained in Engineering. There's no way it could affect something up on Deck Twelve.,BEVERLY: I remember that.

WESLEY: If he were caught in it... yessir, it would seem to us like he'd disappeared.","NATIMA: Then how could you have betrayed me? QUARK: I didn't betray you. NATIMA: Don't lie to me, Quark.

But I will not risk the lives of my crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the Neutral Zone. You have crossed over, Admiral.

ODO: Only important thing is not to betray yourself. he looks at him... a beat... they both know what they're talking about here.,ODO: It's strange. Bek and I were passing acquaintances here on the station. From what little I knew about him, I always thought he was a good man. KIRA: Good men don't betray their own people. ODO: If there's one thing I've learned about humanoids, it's that in extreme situations, even the best of you are capable of doing terrible things.,INTENDANT: It's so good to see you. ROM: Our Ezri would never betray us, which means -- QUARK: Don't start with that again.,QUARK: I know, I know. He couldn't find a cup of water if you dropped him in a lake... but even if he is an idiot, he's still my brother... ODO: And you'd betray him in a second if it suited your interests. QUARK: But that doesn't mean I don't love him... Chief, do you have any brothers?,KIRA: What did he tell you about the massacre? BAREIL: Nerys, you have to understand, he was a monk speaking in confidence to his Vedek. I can't betray that trust. KIRA: I understand. But is there anything else you think I should know? About Bek, or the massacre?,KIRA: Either way, I have to betray someone.

KIRA: How could I possibly turn against my own people?","RASMUSSEN: ""Picard's empath won't trust you."" That's what they all said. TROI: Picard's empath? RASMUSSEN: We're not that unalike, you and I. You possess a sense that is foreign to the others. My knowledge of the future is similar. You know, some of my best friends are empaths... they trust me.,BEVERLY: That's not why you're here. TROI: I'm supposed to be the empath. TROI: Are you all right?,TROI: It's not easy having an overbearing parent. Believe me, I know how you feel. JEV: Oh, yes... I was told you were an empath. TROI: I can't read Ullians. But, I do know a certain Betazoid mother who is a great deal like your father.,DEVINONI: Deanna, it's just business... TROI: Why haven't you told anyone that you're an empath? DEVINONI: I find it makes people uncomfortable.,PICARD: Well? TROI: I don't think you need an empath to sense that woman's feelings. TROI : There's hostility... that she seems to have transferred from Lore... to Data...,DEVINONI: Deanna, people have been doing that for thousands of years, by listening carefully, by watching body language. I just happen to be better at it. You do it. TROI: I do it to help my crew, not outmanueuver them. And I don't hide that I'm an empath. DEVINONI: You announce it to every alien culture you encounter? Or do you use it to give your side an advantage. Do you tell the Romulan in the ship about to attack that you can feel that he's bluffing or do you just tell it to your captain?,TROI: How do I know I won't be killed anyway? N'VEK: Your only chance to get off this ship alive is to do as I say. You are an empath. You would know if I am lying. Am I? TROI: No.,TROI: So just as I'm leaving the reception, a Ktarian walks up to me and says... TROI: ""So Diane... I understand you're an empath. I'm a very... sensitive man myself. I'm doing a thesis on interspecies mating rituals. Would you care to join me in some empirical research?"" GEORDI: Don't tell me -- Doctor Mizan.,PICARD: Then... you deliberately began using Deanna... ALKAR: She's an empath. I was reasonably certain I could establish a link with her. Frankly, I was amazed when I saw how quickly she was aging. Usually my receptacles survive for years. PICARD: Receptacles... ?","SISKO: Memories... events from my past... like this one... JAKE ALIEN: Past? SISKO: Things that happened before now...,PICARD: Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites... PICARD: Past and future... Despair and hope... PICARD: Data, is this part of your program?,QUARK: Durg. Wake up. This is Quark, you're talking to. Remember. DURG: All past debts have been settled. QUARK: They'll never be settled. You'd still be rotting in a Cardassian jail if I hadn't...,MARTOK: It's true. GOWRON: Then what's past is past! If Martok considers you his brother, that's all I need to know. GOWRON: Come! I brought a barrel of the finest bloodwine and it must be drunk tonight!,ODO: Well I haven't forgiven you. DEEP SPACE NINE: ""Behind the Lines"" - REV. 8/21/97 - ACT TWO 18. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: It's time to put the past behind us. ODO: What about the present? You're waging war against my home.,TROI: Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. PICARD: But these courts happened in our past.... TROI: I don't understand either, but this is real. I can feel that!,RIKER: But that's what you're talking about doing anyway, isn't it? Altering the past. PICARD: We're talking about restoring the past. GEORDI: How could Guinan know that history has been altered... if she's been altered along with the rest of us?,JAKE ALIEN: Then how can you take responsibility for your actions... SISKO: We use past experience to help guide us. SISKO: For Jennifer and me, all the experiences in our lives prepared us for the day we met on the beach... helped us recognize that we had a future together. When we married, we accepted all the consequences of that act, whatever they might be... including the consequence of you.","TROI: Bring me an order of... Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order. WORF: Caviar... for lunch? TROI: I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no stranger than what you're eating.,BASHIR: Say you agree. Say you disagree. Say you hate theater. Just say something. O'BRIEN: Look, Julian, you said you wanted to have lunch... so we're having lunch. BASHIR: Yes. But I was hoping for a little more... conversation with my plomeek soup.,GARAK: No. But it seems there's a great deal they didn't teach me. Like the value of a good game of chance... or how indulging in fantasy can keep one's mind... creative. BASHIR: See you at lunch tomorrow? GARAK: Of course. But why don't we have lunch at your place -- in Hong Kong. That is, if this wasn't your last mission.,QUARK: It's never too late. So how long are you going to be on the station? GARAK: Thank you for another enjoyable lunch. Doctor. NATIMA: I didn't think there'd be any Cardassians left on the station.","BASHIR: What's that? GARAK: The truth. BASHIR: I've about given up on learning the truth from you, Garak.,ODO: It serves the truth. ENINA: The truth. ODO: If there's more to this than meets the eye, I hope you'll explain, because as it stands, this will severely hurt Dax's defense.,O'BRIEN: Is that what I'm supposed to tell myself? BASHIR: It's the truth. BASHIR: Look, I'm sorry I don't have all the answers. All I know for sure is that I'm glad you're back.,ROSS: That's a harsh way to put it. KIRA: The truth often is. ROSS: I really would like to help you, colonel, but my hands are tied.,ENINA: What purpose is this supposed to serve? ODO: It serves the truth. ENINA: The truth.,SISKO: Are you sure you don't want anything? DULMUR: Just the truth, Captain. SISKO: You'll get it. Where do you want to start?,PICARD: Let us do no such damned thing! What is this need of yours for costumes? Have you no identity of your own? ""Q"" : I come in search of truth. PICARD: You come in search of what humanity is!,WORF: They grew you in a test tube... like some kind of fungus... then programmed you like a machine. KOROTH: You are twisting the truth. WORF: You talk to me about the truth? You, who have brought this... lie to life and then called it Kahless?,QUARK: That's it? That's supposed to cheer us up? VIC: The truth shall set you free. QUARK: Do you feel better?,DUKAT: You're sure of that? I can't help you unless you tell me the truth. ZIYAL: I am telling you the truth! The question is have you been telling me the truth. DUKAT: About what?","BAREIL: That was delicious. KIRA: Thank the replicators. BAREIL: Here, let me help.,DAMAR: When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. RUSOT: Federation food replicators? DAMAR: Rusot, we're in no position to turn down help -- no matter where it comes from.,O'BRIEN: I'd settle for five minutes of peace and quiet. SISKO: Chief, I thought you were going to fix the replicators. O'BRIEN: You're absolutely right, Sir. I knew I'd forgotten something. Can't have the operations chief sitting around daydreaming when there's work to be done, can we? I'll get right on it.,DUKAT: Excuse my presumption, but this was my office only two weeks ago... DUKAT: So, have you been able to get the food replicators to work properly? SISKO: Frankly, no.","NOG: A root beer... (off Quark's blank expression) It's an Earth drink... something they serve at the Academy... QUARK: Root beer... This is the end of Ferengi civilization... ODO: May I join you, Lieutenant... ?,BEVERLY: Doctor Stubbs, these nanites are apparently operating with a new collective intelligence... working together, teaching each other skills... DATA: Doctor, are you suggesting they are becoming a... civilization? STUBBS: Oh really. I'm sorry but this is nonsense. You can't have a civilization of computer chips. They're made in a plant in Dakar Senegal. I've watched the construction.,KIRA: We already have a solution and the longer we wait the harder it will be to implement it. I'm sorry but this is us or them. We have to destroy it. ODO: You can't just wipe out a civilization... we would be committing mass murder. KIRA: (can't anyone see this but me?) It's like stepping on ants, Odo.,ADMINISTRATOR: Evacuated to where? Our technology is limited. We're just beginning to launch small missiles... PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then -- something, anything -- you can't just let this civilization die -- ADMINISTRATOR: Enough! There is a plan in the works. I can't tell you more than that.,VASH: Thank you, Doctor. I try. BASHIR: I'd say you've managed quite well for someone who's been out of contact with civilization for over two years. VASH: I'd hardly call the Gamma Quadrant uncivilized. Some of the cultures I've encountered have histories dating back millions of years.,SISKO: I'll give you my decision in an hour. SISKO : Personal log. Supplemental. One hour. One hour to make a decision that could mean the life or death of a civilization. Or the end to our own. SISKO : My mind keeps going back to the Borg... how I despised their... indifference as they tried to exterminate us. And I have to ask myself... would I be any different if I destroyed another universe to preserve my own?,DATA: My impression is that there were thousands... of all ages and walks of life. It was a remarkable experience. PICARD: Well, Data, you may never become fully human... but you've had an experience that transcends the human condition. You have been an entire civilization. PICARD: Nonetheless... it's time to stand watch on the night shift.,DATA: Doctor, are you suggesting they are becoming a... civilization? STUBBS: Oh really. I'm sorry but this is nonsense. You can't have a civilization of computer chips. They're made in a plant in Dakar Senegal. I've watched the construction. BEVERLY: Then how do you explain what you've seen here?","BASHIR: I don't know, but whoever he was, he lived like a pig. KIRA: It was Weyoun. BASHIR: Weyoun? The Vorta?,KIRA: It was Weyoun. BASHIR: Weyoun? The Vorta? KIRA: I always knew he was a bit of a packrat. I'd see him collecting little bits of junk from all over the station and taking them back to his quarters to--,SISKO: Love you too. JAKE : Excuse me, Mister Weyoun. WEYOUN: Please, I prefer just ""Weyoun."",JAKE : Excuse me, Mister Weyoun. WEYOUN: Please, I prefer just ""Weyoun."" JAKE: That's the kind of detail people want to know. Would this be a good time?,WEYOUN: (to the Female Shape-shifter, solicitous) Is there anything else I can do for you? FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: Have you located Weyoun Six? WEYOUN: It's only a matter of time.,WEYOUN: You're not going to die. You're a god. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER: My loyal Weyoun... the only Solid I've ever trusted. WEYOUN: I live only to serve you.,WV-SIX: Of course you would, you're a god. WEYOUN: To think that a Weyoun could be capable of such treachery. DAMAR: I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met.
