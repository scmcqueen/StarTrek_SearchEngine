I'll   go get it...,       Believe what ya want... just   don't light that candle.,"   And I loved all of them... and   they loved me.       Give me the candle, Beverly.",   That candle has brought nothing   but misery and bad luck to your   grandmother.,       This is a kor'tova candle... it   represents the fire that burns in   a warrior's heart.,   It appears a small hunter probe    was hidden in a ceremonial candle    and fired a disruptor blast.,   It's not easy for me to take   corporeal form... I can't do it   for long. I want you to light the   candle...,"   Yes... if I'm away from it for too   long, I begin to weaken.
