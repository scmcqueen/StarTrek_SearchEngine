We hid in the hills for two days, but finally the lack of food and water forced us down into the valley. We made our way to a ridge above a small lake. As I was the only one still carrying a phaser, I went ahead to scout for the enemy. Halfway down the embankment I slipped and went sprawling on my back down to the edge of the lake just as a huge Cardassian emerged from the water. He must have just finished bathing. He stood there frozen in surprise, dressed only in his underwear, shivering from the cold. I lay there looking up at him too stunned to move.

And no matter how hard I denied it, the story continued to spread until it seemed all of Bajor had heard it. Soon every victory won by the resistance was attributed to my leadership. Stories of my courage, my brilliance, my daring grew more and more unbelievable... yet people insisted on believing them.
