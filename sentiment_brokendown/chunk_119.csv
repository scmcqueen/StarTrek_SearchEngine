You see, this Jack Crusher won't exist by the time you're grown up... I'll be older, more experienced... hopefully a little wiser. But this person will be gone and I wanted you to know who I am now, who your father was when you came into this world. I see you lying there in your crib... and I realize that I don't know the first thing about being a father. So let me just apologize for all the mistakes I'm about to make as you grow up. (disturbed by the thought) I hope you don't grow up... resenting the fact that I was gone so much. That comes with this uniform. Right now, I'm waiting for an assignment on the U.S.S. Stargazer. I don't know if I can explain why Starfleet is so important to me... maybe you'll understand when you get this... later on. Maybe you'll even want to try one of these on.
