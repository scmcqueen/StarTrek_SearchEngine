You see, this Jack Crusher won't exist by the time you're grown up... I'll be older, more experienced... hopefully a little wiser. But this person will be gone and I wanted you to know who I am now, who your father was when you came into this world. I see you lying there in your crib... and I realize that I don't know the first thing about being a father. So let me just apologize for all the mistakes I'm about to make as you grow up. (disturbed by the thought) I hope you don't grow up... resenting the fact that I was gone so much. That comes with this uniform. Right now, I'm waiting for an assignment on the U.S.S. Stargazer. I don't know if I can explain why Starfleet is so important to me... maybe you'll understand when you get this... later on. Maybe you'll even want to try one of these on. (thinks, gives up, laughs a little) You'll probably be a doctor like your mother. We named you after Richard Wesley Crusher, my grandfather, who gave me my first flying lesson as a boy.
