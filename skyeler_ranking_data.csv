 QUARK: Yeah... don't want to think about her do you? Let me refresh your memory... You signed a standard five year marriage contract with Prinadora's father because you wanted a child. A simple, everyday, business deal. But then... you fell in love with your wife and wanted to extend the contract. And you were so in love you never bothered to read the extension before signing it. So in the end, her father swindled you out of all your money... Prinadora left you for a richer man... and you got stuck with Nog. Hooray for romance.
